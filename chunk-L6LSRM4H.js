The design uses a single, primary laser beam source and homodyne detection, which provides a common-beam path for all laser beams. In the first crystal (SH1) a second harmonic is created from the primary beam, allowing the sample to be probed at two wavelengths and producing a phase shift by optical dispersion. In the second crystal (SH2) another second harmonic is created that reproduces the phase shift of the residual primary beam, allowing the dispersive-phase shift to be subsequently measured between the two second-harmonic beams. The result is a single, common-path optical design that is immune to mechanical and electrical noise, is less complex and lower cost than alternative (dual-beam line) interferometers.
