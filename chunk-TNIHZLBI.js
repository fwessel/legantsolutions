Our company was founded to supply cost-effective laboratory equipment. We represent products manufactured by Zeonics Systech, of Bangalore India. Since 1981 Zeonics has provided some of the highest-quality/highest-performance products available on the world market; LES has partnered with them since 2017. "),t(),e(6,"p"),n(7," LES also sells a second-harmonic, dispersion-interferometer (SHDI) available in two configurations - as a 1-dimensional, line-of-sight instrument and a 2-dimensional, transverse-imaging instrument. The design of the SHDI is robustly stable with a broad range in sensitivity. It has been used to quantitatively measure density as a dispersive phase shift in plasma, gas, and liquids. Dispersion interferometry offers a tremendous improvement over conventional 2-arm interferometer methods in terms of its simplicity, performance, and cost. Please refer to the several published papers on these instruments referenced on the Diagnostics page.
