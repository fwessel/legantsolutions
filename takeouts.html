<p>My research career started with a Ph.D. in physics, from the University of California, Irvine,
                        studying
                        the direct injection of intense ion beams into a fusion reactor. These are not the typical neutral-atomic beams
                        used widely  today. They are pulsed, high-current density, plasmoid beams, that penetrate the transverse-magnetic field
                        by a collective, self-polarization (ExB drift) effect. The potential impact of this technology is to enable access
                        to a particle-energy regime  that is well suited for fusion, in the range of 100-1,000 keV, where neutral-atomic beams
                        are either not possible, or not cost-effective. After finishing at UCI, I went to the Hughes Research Laboratories, where I worked on
                        ion-space propulsion. My big accomplishment was extending the propulsion system power-density and thrust
                        performance 5-fold, while also
                        reducing the "parts count" 100-fold (USPTO#4,638,149). </p>
                    <p>HRL was close to UCLA, so I used the opportunity to attend their seminars on entrepreneurship. At that time startups did not
                        have the same cach&eacute as they do today. Eventually, I was confident enough in my ability, that I convinced my
                        HRL colleagues to embark on writing our own business
                        plan,&nbsp;developing focused-ion beams for microelectronics. We succeeded at getting it funded as MicroBeam, Inc.
                        Shortly after we opened our doors, I left the company, as our funding was
                        (strongly) dependent upon the use of  sales forecasts  that were probably more "optimistic" (100's of units X $1 M/unit) than
                        what reality was likely to support.</p>

                    <p>Soon thereafter, I returned to UC Irvine, doing R &amp D on the propagation of intense ion beams, magnetic-field compression in a
                        Z-pinch, x-ray lithography, and Z-pinch fusion. Z-pinches are an interesting pulsed-power device, since they provide a simple and easy way to produce extremes in the
                        compressed-plasma-energy density. A few years later I succeeded in funding the "Staged Z-pinch" (SZP) Project for Fusion,
                        in a highly competitive Department of Energy procurement
                        for alternate fusion concepts. Eventually, this research lead to a new method for energy
                        delivery in a fusion target, with
                        many papers and two patents (USPTO#8,837,661 & #9,839,111), and the basis for my third start-up, 15 years later, as
                        Magneto-Inertial Fusion Technologies, Inc.
                        (MIFTI); which continues today to develop the SZP for fusion and the production of medical
                        isotopes.</p>

                    <p>My earlier PhD work with Norman Rostoker, on intense-ion beam propagation/injection evolved into another
                        new concept for
                        fusion, based on a Field-Reversed Magnetic Configuration (FRC). Basically, the magnetic
                        configuration was linear,
                        high-magnetic beta, and with the use of intense-ion beams at MeV energies, allowed for the use of
                        advanced fusion fuel cycles. These fuel cycles are attractive over the conventional approach with hydrogen
                        isotopes, because there are fusion fuels that generate energy without neutrons (hence, no radioactivity).
                        One day, while Norman and I were chatting about the lack of  vision in the fusion community for alternate concepts
                        and specifically funding for our idea, it occurred to me that we
                        should just write a business plan and try to raise money ourselves. We eventually did that, and with others, formed what
                        was called Tri Alpha
                        Energy, Inc, my second startup; which was based on the use of Hydrogen and Boron to produce three Helium nuclei
                        (alpha particles). Finding an appropriate name for the company, with the strong opinions of such an eclectic
                        group of co-founders, was a particular challenge! Nevertheless, I prevailed and the "obvious name" was adopted.</p>

                    <p>I recently decided to try something a little different that is less focused on developing
                    new fusion ideas, and instead on providing cost-effective solutions, components, and diagnostics;
                    many of which are compiled here on the L-Egant Solutions website. So, here we are.-->
